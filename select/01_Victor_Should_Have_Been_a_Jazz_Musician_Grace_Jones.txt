I went to a concert
To see Nina Simone
The concert was over
There was still a band playing, the wrap up

The bongo man played his beat with his hands
I closed my eyes and looked at him
Victor should have been a jazz musician
I said to myself, Victor should have been a jazz musician

I looked at his face, and I saw Victor
Looked at his smile, and I saw Victor
I looked at his hair,
And thought Victor should have been a jazz musician
Victor should have been a jazz musician

There were people, dancing on the floor (Dancing on the floor)
They were so high
You should have seen Victor smile (You should have seen
Victor smile as they danced all the while, all around on the floor)
And he laughed

Victor should have been a jazz musician
Oh, Victor should have been a jazz musician
He was playing so nice, the jazz musician
Ah, ah

He's living in a fast beat, in a city that's hot
Telling all the Latinos and the Puerto Ricans
Victor seems happy, but he doesn't even know himself
He's gotta look inside to know his first love

Victor was a jazz musician (Gotta look inside to know)
He was a jazz musician
In his first life, he was a jazz, musician
Victor was a jazz musician

Somewhere, Victor plays his music, he loves his music
Somewhere, Victor loves his music, he plays his music
Somewhere, Victor is a jazz musician
Jazz
