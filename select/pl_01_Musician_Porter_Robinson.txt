No, I don't miss the feeling
anymore
Yeah,
I want something new to love
I was so nostalgic
But I'm fine without it
You don't really want
what you think you want
No, I don't wanna lose it
This emotion
Yeah, I just wanna do everything
I get so excited
When I finally find it
It just gets brighter
from now on
Then you sigh
"You know I love you, so I think
I should tell you, Porter
This life: isn't it time
that you grow up?"
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
Well, this is why we do it
For the feeling
How do you do music?
Well, it's easy
You just face your fears
And you become your heroes
I don't understand
why you're freaking out
Then they say
"Fine, well do what you need to
But I don't want to see you
Wasting your life
Isn't it time you get a job?"
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
And I know it doesn't last
But I don't mind at all anymore
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
